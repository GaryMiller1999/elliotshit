aws-auto-inventory --help
usage: aws-auto-inventory [-h] --name NAME

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --name NAME, -n NAME  inventory name

### Problem
Projects usually have several resources and fetching all the information manually is a very time-consuming task.
This issue is intensified when the same project have multiple environments, e.g.: NonProd, QA and/or Prod.

### Solution
Provide a simple way to fetch the required information and generate a spreadsheet.
The information can be filtered, e.g. filter results by tag:x, vpc, subnets, etc.

Download the binary according to your operating system and platform. After you can execute it directly.
You will need to create a `config.yaml` file in order to tell the tool how to generate your inventory, here are the default search paths for each platform:

* OS X: `~/.config/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml` or  `~/Library/Application Support/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml`
* Other Unix: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml` or  `~/.config/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\aws-auto-inventory\config.yaml` where the `APPDATA` environment variable falls back to `%HOME%\AppData\Roaming\config.yaml` if undefined

You can use the [config-sample](config-sample.yaml) as an example. A snippet can be found below:
```
inventories:
  - name: your-inventory-name
    aws:
      profile: your-aws-profile
      region:
        - us-east-1
    excel:
      transpose: true
    sheets:
      - name: EC2 # sheet name on Excel
        service: ec2 # the boto3 client of an AWS service
        function: describe_instances # the client method of the service defined above
        result_key: Reservations # [optional]: The first key of the response dict
      - name: EBS
        service: ec2
        function: describe_volumes
        result_key: Volumes
