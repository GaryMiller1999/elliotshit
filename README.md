# AWS Automated Inventory

Automates creation of detailed inventories from AWS resources.

### Problem
Projects usually have several resources and fetching all the information about these resources manually is a very time-consuming task.
This issue is intensified when the same project have multiple account and/or environments, e.g.: NonProd, QA and/or Prod.

### Solution
Provide a simple way to fetch the required information and generate a spreadsheet.
The information can be filtered, e.g. filter results by tag:x, vpc, subnets, etc.
Additionally, inventories can be generated related to many services, which are collected and organized per sheet in the spreadsheet.

## Prerequisites
  A list of things you need, or how to install them.

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org) - Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.


## Installation
Download the binary under [releases](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-auto-inventory/releases).

You will need to create a `config.yaml` file in order to tell the tool how to generate your inventory, here are the default search paths for each platform:
* OS X: `~/.config/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml` or  `~/Library/Application Support/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml`
* Other Unix: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml` or  `~/.config/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\aws-auto-inventory\config.yaml` where the `APPDATA` environment variable falls back to `%HOME%\AppData\Roaming\config.yaml` if undefined
You can use the [config-sample](config-sample.yaml) as an example. A snippet can be found below:
```yaml
inventories:
  - name: your-inventory-name
    aws: # optional
      profile: your-aws-profile # if not provided, the AWS environment variables will be used instead
      region: # if not provided, 'us-east-1' will be used as default region
        - us-east-1
    excel:
      transpose: true
    sheets:
      - name: EC2 # sheet name on Excel
        service: ec2 # the boto3 client of an AWS service
        function: describe_instances # the client method of the service defined above
        result_key: Reservations # [optional]: The first key of the response dict
      - name: EBS
        service: ec2
        function: describe_volumes
        result_key: Volumes
```
If you are interested in building an inventory for multiple AWS Accounts
(within your AWS organization) with the same sheets, you can use the
[config-sample-for-organization](config-sample-for-organization.yaml) for simplicity.
Code snippet:
```yaml
Sheets: &sheets
  - name: CloudFrontDistros
    service: cloudfront
    function: list_distributions
    result_key: DistributionList
  - name: S3Buckets
    service: s3
    function: list_buckets
    result_key: Buckets
inventories:
  - name: your-org-master
    aws:
      profile: your-org
      region:
        - us-east-1
    excel:
      transpose: true
    sheets: *sheets
  - name: your-org-account1
    aws:
      profile: your-org-account1
      region:
        - us-east-1
    excel:
      transpose: true
    sheets: *sheets
  - name: your-org-account2
    aws:
      profile: your-org-account2
      region:
        - us-east-1
    excel:
      transpose: true
    sheets: *sheets
```
Then you need to run the auto-inventory script multiple times for your accounts as follows:
```shell
./dist/aws-auto-inventory --name your-org-master
./dist/aws-auto-inventory --name your-org-account1
./dist/aws-auto-inventory --name your-org-account1
```
Now, download the binary according to your operating system and platform and execute it, informing which inventory you want to generate.
The tool will create a folder `aws-auto-inventory-report`, in the current path, with the inventory report inside.


## Usage
```
aws-auto-inventory --help
usage: aws-auto-inventory [-h] --name NAME
Automates creation of detailed inventories from AWS resources.
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --name NAME, -n NAME  inventory name
```


## Testing
AWS-Auto-Inventory uses [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3).
You can use any service that contains any list or describe method to fetch information about your resources.
### Parameters
You can use [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) parameters to narrow down your search results.
#### Filter by tag:Name
```
sheets:
  - name: VPC
    service: ec2

          Values:
            - my-vpc
```
### Filter by vpc-id
```
sheets:
  - name: Subnets
    service: ec2
    function: describe_subnets
    result_key: Subnets
    parameters:
      Filters:
        - Name: vpc-id
          Values:
            - vpc-xxx
```
### Find a particular RDS instance
```
sheets:
  - name: RDS
    service: rds
    function: describe_db_instances
    result_key: DBInstances
