  ### Problem
  Projects usually have several resources and fetching all the information manually is a very time-consuming task.
  This issue is intensified when the same project have multiple environments, e.g.: NonProd, QA and/or Prod.

  ### Solution
  Provide a simple way to fetch the required information and generate a spreadsheet.
  The information can be filtered, e.g. filter results by tag:x, vpc, subnets, etc.
installing: |-
  Download the binary according to your operating system and platform. After you can execute it directly.
  You will need to create a `config.yaml` file in order to tell the tool how to generate your inventory, here are the default search paths for each platform:

  * OS X: `~/.config/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml` or  `~/Library/Application Support/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml`
  * Other Unix: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml` or  `~/.config/aws-auto-inventory/config.yaml`
  * Windows: `%APPDATA%\aws-auto-inventory\config.yaml` where the `APPDATA` environment variable falls back to `%HOME%\AppData\Roaming\config.yaml` if undefined

  You can use the [config-sample](config-sample.yaml) as an example. A snippet can be found below:
  ```
  inventories:
    - name: your-inventory-name
      aws:
        profile: your-aws-profile
        region:
          - us-east-1
      excel:
        transpose: true
      sheets:
        - name: EC2 # sheet name on Excel
          service: ec2 # the boto3 client of an AWS service
          function: describe_instances # the client method of the service defined above
          result_key: Reservations # [optional]: The first key of the response dict
        - name: EBS
          service: ec2
          function: describe_volumes
          result_key: Volumes
  ```
testing: |-
  AWS-Auto-Inventory uses [boto3][boto3].
  You can use any service that contains any list or describe method to fetch information about your resources.
  For example, let's say I have the following configuration:

  ```
  aws:
    profile: my-aws-profile
    region:
      - us-east-1

  inventory:
    - sheet1:
        name: EC2
        service: ec2
        function: describe_instances
  ```
